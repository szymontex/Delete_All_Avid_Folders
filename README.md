# Delete_All_Avid_Folders
Very simple powershell script that recursively deletes all folders in your system drive 'C:\' that include name "Avid"


============================================================

If you work with audio and install a lot of various plugins, and you're outside of Avid/ProTools domain, there's a chance that you're having a lot of unused AAX plugins installed on your system. 

ofc. you're using it at your own risk
